## States

### VaultState

The core state structure stored in each vault account:

```rust
pub struct VaultState {
    pub owner: Pubkey,  // 32 bytes
}
```

- **Size**: 32 bytes (Pubkey)
- **PDA Seed**: `"vault"`
- **Validation**: Includes PDA validation and owner verification
- **Methods**: `initialize()`, `validate_pda()`

## Building

```bash
chio build
